## 🗃️ Database Schema

The application uses a local SQLite database named `library.db`, which is automatically created on the first launch. It contains three main tables with foreign key relationships:

---

### 📘 Books

Stores information about books and their current lending status.

| Column         | Type     | Description                             |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `Id`           | INTEGER  | Primary key (autoincrement)             |
| `Title`        | TEXT     | Book title                              |
| `Year`         | INTEGER  | Year of publication                     |
| `AuthorId`     | INTEGER  | Foreign key → `Authors(Id)`             |
| `ReaderId`     | INTEGER  | Foreign key → `Readers(Id)` (nullable)  |
| `BorrowedDate` | TEXT     | Date when the book was borrowed (nullable, ISO 8601 format) |

---

### 👨‍🎨 Authors

Stores data about authors.

| Column       | Type     | Description                      |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| `Id`         | INTEGER  | Primary key (autoincrement)      |
| `FullName`   | TEXT     | Author's full name               |
| `Country`    | TEXT     | Country of origin (optional)     |
| `BirthYear`  | INTEGER  | Year of birth (optional)         |

---

### 🧍 Readers

Stores data about library readers (borrowers).

| Column        | Type     | Description                        |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| `Id`          | INTEGER  | Primary key (autoincrement)        |
| `FullName`    | TEXT     | Reader's full name                 |
| `Contact`     | TEXT     | Contact information (optional)     |
| `Registered`  | TEXT     | Date of registration (ISO format)  |

---

### 🔗 Relationships

- Each **Book** is linked to **one Author** via `AuthorId`.
- Each **Book** may optionally be linked to a **Reader** via `ReaderId`.
- `BorrowedDate` is only set if the book is currently borrowed.

All foreign keys are enforced by SQLite using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
